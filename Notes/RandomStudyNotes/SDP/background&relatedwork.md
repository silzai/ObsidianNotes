In the field of Multi-Modal LLMs (MLLMs) we have classified the MLLM architectures into 2 groups, namely "Image Encoder Architectures" and "Non-Image Encoder Architectures". They are both explained as following:
# Image Encoder Architectures
To introduce MLLM architectures with image encoders (LLaMA3 paper) have stated that the researchers performed experiments where they connected a pre-trained image encoder and their pre-trained language model using a set of "cross-attention" layers using a set of image-text pairs. 0
