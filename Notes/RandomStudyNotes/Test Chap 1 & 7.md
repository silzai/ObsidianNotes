> Avogadro's number: $6.023\times 10^{-23}$ 
> 1 mole of any gas occupies $22.414\space dm^3$ of volume
 
1) Determine the volume of 2.5 moles of chlorine molecules at STP.

2) Find the percentage composition of $H_2O$.

3) You have this formula: $$K_2Cr_2O_7+4H_2SO_4→K_2SO_4+Cr2(SO4)_3+4H_2O+3O$$ $K_2Cr_2O_7$ and $H_2SO_4$ were reacted, both had a mass of $200g$, calculate
	a) the mass of oxygen produced,
	b) the mass of reactant left unreacted

4) You have this formula: $$Zn + CuSO_4 → ZnSO_4 + Cu$$ Calculate the percentage yield when: 
- $CuSO_4$ had a mass of $1.274g$, $Zn$ was in excess and $Cu$ had a yield of $0.392g$

5) Define an acid in terms of the Bronsted concept and give an example.

6) Define amphoteric substance and give an example.

> *The Following may be useful:*
> $K_w$ is the ionic product constant of water, where $K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0\times10^{-14}$
> $pH = -log[H^+]$ 
> $pOH = -log[OH^-]$ 

7)  Calculate the concentration of $[H^+]$ in household ammonia solution and the concentration of $[OH^-]$ in it is $0.005M$.

8) Calculate the $pH$ of a $0.062M$ $NaOH$ solution.


> *The Following may be useful:*
> For a conjugate acid base pair, $K_a \times K_b = K_w$ 
> and $pK_a + pK_b = pK_w = 14$ at $25 \degree C$   

9) The $pK_b$ of pyridine at $25\degree C$ is 8.25, calculate the $pK_a$ of the conjugate acid of pyridine.

10) Define an acid in terms of the Lewis concept and give an example.

> *The Following may be useful:*
> For Acidic Buffers: $pH = pK_a + log\frac{[salt]}{[acid]}$ 
> For Basic Buffers: $pOH = pK_b + log\frac{[salt]}{[base]}$

11)  If concentration $CH_3COOH$ is $0.1M$ and $CH_3COONa$ is $1.0M$, and $pK_a$ for $CH_3COOH$ is $4.76$, what is the $pH$ of the buffer?

12) Define salt hydrolysis with an example.

13) Define The Levelling Effect with an example.
