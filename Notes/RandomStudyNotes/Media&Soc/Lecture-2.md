# Modes Of Communication:
- intrapersonal: 
	- has no noise, all communication between you and yourself
	- but a person with Alzheimer's may not be properly classified as intrapersonal communication
	- grows self-confidence
	- preparation for the future
- interpersonal (dyadic communication): 2 people
- group communication: 
	- small group communication: 
		- 3-12 people, ideas can be shared
	- large group communication: 
		- the larger the group is, the more messages are miscommunicated, may be misinterpreted, that's why bigger networks are unreliable
- public communication: 
	- when people gather, and the unit is too large for everyone to talk and contribute
- mass communication: 
	- all different people in different times, different places receive the same message
	- mass communication nowadays:
		- I can filter out/ignore the news and I don't want to see and do active picking whereas previously, there was just a few news channels, so we had to watch only that, so the abundance of sources are 
	- social media:
		- it is large group communication
- inter-cultural communication:

# Models of Media Communication
- Narrative model: 
	- from Laswell's model
		- Who -> What -> Channel -> Audience = Effect
	- who says what
	- to measure effect on audiences who got a message:
		- make a survey 
		- ignores feedback, and ignores noise
		- TV providers use the Nielsen system:
			- to see what is prime time tv for everyone, so track people on their IPtv to see that, and broadcaster can see what you are seeing.
		- some electoral sites asked every sixth person who they voted for
		- can see the sales of the product after the advertisement
>[!info] With regards to "Effect" in Laswells model:  
>even if there is correlation, will have to see if the causation is the actual source
	
- Concentric Circle Model:
	- Idea originates from great thinkers, that are at the center
	- after we get to the audience, the effects are measured
	- there is amplification, as opposed to noise, 
>[!info] Tip on why there are different media
>Movie goers like movies, so books are made into movies, radio listeners like radio, so books are made into podcasts

- 21st Century Model:
