- mass media: vehicles through which messages are sent to mass audiences
- mass communication: related to a technology and size of its audience
	- process of dividing the message to send to a people of a specific interest (targeted communication to people)
- mass communication is a subset of mass media

- some Germans/Americans came up with the term mass communication, that means that receiver receives the message exactly as the sender sent it.
- but not every information is understood the same way by people of different age/race etc.
- mass communication is not really a word nowadays, so just the term communication or strategic communication is in hit, 

- media ubiquity: 
	- media is everywhere, and we consume it consciously or unconsciously
	- we do media multitasking (the word is self explanatory)
		- ex: we will have multiple types of media giving us different messages at the same time
	- inescapable symbiosis:
		- personal dependence on media
		- and without us (consumers), media cannot survive
		- "when one falls, the other does"

- How do we use mass media in daily life?
	- for example, mass comm can be even with ourself, so we can just convince ourself of doing something
- purposes of mass communication:
	- to inform
	- to persuade
	- to entertain
- Literacy for media consumer:
	- linguistic literacy
	- film literacy
	- visual literacy

## Media Literacy:
- ALL journalism is biased, it can never be neutral, even if they lean on being as neutral as possible
- AI is rampant, so there should be literacy in AI, and need to be careful
- We may fall for false news if we WANT it to happen; it will make us benefit; will make us happier

# sender and receiver cycle (diagram):
- sender encodes the message (the way the sender frames the message, hoping it is understood that way to the receiver) ->
- and passes it through a channel -> 
- and receiver decodes it -> 
- and gives feedback to the sender (could be body language or verbal, anything), 
- all the while noise being present from the sender, on the channel, or at the receiver, noise may be bias with the sender and receiver, their background, or anything

- showed a video by vox about misinformation
	- told that elections were now like a reality show instead of actual real world discussions
