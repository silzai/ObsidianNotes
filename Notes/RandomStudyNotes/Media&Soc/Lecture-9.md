# Media Effects and Research
- Mcqual:
	- its not really sure that there are effects by media, but
## The four theories of Press:
- by 3 people in 1956: Fred Siebert, Theodore Peterson, and Wilbur Schramm
- They are: 
	- Authoritarian:
		- media serves interests of the state, and media may be censored
	- Libertarian:
		- Total divide between state and people
		- "free press theory"
		- individuals should have the right to publish whatever they want
	- Soviets Communists:
		- media is controlled by state
		- but supposed to serve the working class
	- Social Responsibility:
		- media should be free from government control
		- but also should serve the interests of the people
		- example: when the capitol riot, trump encourage citizen journalists to report on ground there
- But these theories are outdated
# Two Step flow:
- need only to reach messages to particular audiences, and not more
- then those audiences will spread the message
	- example: the opinion leaders will actually propagate the message to the masses as opposed to the speaker/author/president themself.
## multi-step flow:

# Phase 3: Cumulative Effects

- Gratification theory: 
	- use media to satisfy/gratify our own needs

# Social Constructivism:
- Agenda setting:
	- The topic that is picked by media is already being talked by the public i.e. what the public demands action on 
	- Only ash was seen from volcano eruption in tanga (oceania), and no much help was sent, but the submarine implosion was talked about widely
- Framing:
