# Server Side:
- Make scripts for:
	- Webserver Setup
	- SSH Configuration
	- SFTP Configuration
	- DNS Configuration
	- Managing Unsuccessful Attempts Log:
		- make `unsuccessful_attempts.log` using `rsync` tool, do this by taking the logs from client side and consolidate them. 
		- Automatically erase this log after one week
# Client Side:
- `main.sh`: to manage user credentials 
	1) Check User Group Membership
	2) Log Invalid Attempts: save in `invalid_attempts.log`
	3) Handle Excessive Invalid Attempts: save in `unsuccessful_attempts.log` and send to server using `rsync`
	4) Schedule user logout: `gnome-session-quit - -no-prompt`
- `verify.sh`:
	- test by creating an `admin` group and adding `techuser` to it
# Testing:
- Scripts:
	- `meshping.sh` to ping all ==???? Who is pinging who and vice versa and how many times ????==
	- `traceroute.sh` check connectivity using trace route, and reboots the machine in case the target cannot be reached.
		- all info is saved in `network.log`
	- otherwise show the current date with this message `Connectivity with $target_IP is ok`
# tools to use, just fyi:
- apache http server
- quad9 for dns
- ssh
- sftp
- rsync: used to send `client_timestamp_invalid_attempts.log` to the server to consolidate in `unsuccessful_attempts.log`
