# Multi-Threading
- a process is divided into multiple threads, but all threads share the same code, data and files. 
- multicore system vs multiprogramming
	- multicore:
		- multiple cores on one CPU
		- when making parallel program, dividing the activities of the process into optimal sections to run concurrently
> [!note]
> kernel threads should always be less than user threads
