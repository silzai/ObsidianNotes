- concurrent processes -> shared resource -> need synchronization
- also called producer/consumer
- furnace policy
- spinning:
	- thread yield: stop the thread, put it back into ready queue
		- to give turn to other threads
	- problem: doesn't release the lock, so only good for object that doesn't have locks
	- to solve `yield()` will use `wait()`: 
		- if blocked then, will make `wait()` , this will put thread in `wait set`
		- `notify()` will move from wait set to `entry set` to make it runnable
		- can use `notifyAll()` to move all threads in wait set to `entry set`
- Recursive Lock:
	- you can obtain lock for multiple methods manipulating same object
- nested lock:
	- if manipulating different objects, then will have nested locks
