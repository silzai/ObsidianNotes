- 3 different techniques:
	- fast registers if entries are very small
	- PTBR, register that contains the address of the page table in memory
	- TLB: is the best if affordable, replacement for page table ==??==
- to speed up page table search time:
	- hierarchical: 
		- divide the page table to 2 or more page tables
		- number of bits to represent page: 5 bits
		- want to design it as 2 level hierarchy, 3 bits first level, 2 bits second level

- LRU approximation: ==????==
