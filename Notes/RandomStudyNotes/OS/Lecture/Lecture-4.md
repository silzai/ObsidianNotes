# Processes and System Calls
- process states transition:
	- fork will create a process -> process comes in job queue -> scheduler assign it to -> ready queue (processes that are loaded into memory, process will become "running" but can also be swapped to the disk if no space is available) -> short???queue (this is where cpu executes the processes)
- every process has a block in memory called PCB (process control block), its like the identity of process, as it contains the information about the process, such as process number.
- process may be executed, or waiting for io, in this case we suspend the process and sends it back to ready queue and choose another process
	- will use context switching to do this
	- context switching time is the idle time while processes are switching
- if process doesn't finish processing within time limit, then again will send to ready queue and choose another process (called round robin schedule)
- difference between kernel mode and user mode, is that kernel mode has all privileges to access system resources
- User processes:
- Kernel processes:
