- In the intro lecture, where he explained the syllabus, the dr motivated the identity of Arabs and Muslims and briefly went over their achievements and what the westerners adopted from us in the field of education.
- An example is that the westerners adopted the practice of wearing a university gown and and cap, this was first introduced by Muslims in Al-Andalus where they used to wear a bisht to symbolize an achievement and tied a Quran on their heads to symbolize that God is watching over them.
- Cultures are different from one place to another, when Imam Shafi came to Egypt he saw a different culture so changed about 60% of his teachings when he went from Iraq to Egypt.
- Also motivated to us the fact that having no guidance (i.e. the Quran) puts no boundaries on what humans are and are not allowed to do, which leads to humans committing atrocities, for example, The American bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

- The Dr Zakaryya got all the students to introduce their countries and their cultures, to get a hands on experience on this day's lecture, which was about culture of humans, which is basically a process of collection of habits which is added though interactions, behaviors which includes knowledge belief art law custom and is a product of a socialization process etc.
- equality/frequency of patterns of people in a culture might variate, but all of the patterns will be the same.
- Culture is passed from one generation to another.
- Some students did not raise hands when the Dr asked to everyone with a show of hands on a question about multicultural society and a single cultural society, Have to live a balanced life, gave an example from a tafsir of the story of fishing on Saturday, that people that remain in the middle are lowest.
- Single culture societies are very strong as it is clear what their identity is, there is a mainstream idea on the culture, and if someone outside wants to come, he must adopt that places culture. and for example, Qatar, multi-cultural societies are very difficult to manage, but good thing is that they are very tolerant, otherwise they will be termed racist, for example, UK. If someone outside wants to come, he can be flexible with the culture.
