- In the introductory lecture, the professor explained the syllabus, and motivated the identity of Arabs and Muslims and briefly went over their achievements and what the westerners adopted from us in the field of education.
- An example about that was the westerners adopted the practice of wearing a university gown and and cap, this was first introduced by Muslims in Al-Andalus where they used to wear a Bisht to symbolize an achievement and tied a Quran on their heads to symbolize that God is watching over them.
- Cultures are different from one place to another, when Imam Shafi came to Egypt he saw a different culture so changed about 60% of his teachings when he went from Iraq to Egypt.
- He also motivated to us the fact that having no guidance (i.e. the Quran and religion) puts no boundaries on what humans are and are not allowed to do, which leads to humans committing atrocities, for example, The American bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
- *Reflection:* this first lecture introduced for me the teaching style would be different from others, where the professor had more of a conversation with the students instead of it being a monologue-style lecture, and the professor would tell us different point of views and information, so we may question and think about them.
## 20-06-2023
- Dr Zakaryya got all the students to introduce their countries and their cultures in detail, to get more of a feeling for this day's lecture, which was about the culture of humans, which is basically a process of collection of habits which is added though interactions, behaviors which includes knowledge, belief, art, law, custom and is a product of a socialization process etc. The interaction with our classmates gave me an insight on different cultures such as the history and food of different people
- equality/frequency of patterns of people in a culture might variate, but all of the patterns will be the same.
- Culture is passed from one generation to another.
- branching off from the main discussion, when some students did not raise hands when the Dr asked to everyone with a show of hands on a question about multicultural society and a single cultural society, he encouraged us to live a balanced life, gave an example of a tafsir from Syed Qudb of the story of fishing on Saturday, that people that remain in the middle are lowest, and they are not worth mentioning in the Quran.
- *Single culture societies* are very strong as it is clear what their identity is, there is a mainstream idea on the culture, and if someone outside wants to come, he must adopt that places culture, for example Qatar, but the good thing here is that the cultural identity is uniform and there is no confusion on the nature of the culture. *Multi-cultural societies* are very difficult to manage, but good thing is that they are very tolerant, otherwise they will be termed racist, for example, UK. If someone outside wants to come, he can be flexible with the culture. 
- The Dr set forth a question at the end of class about whether is there a difference between culture and civilization

## 22-06-2023
- The Dr set forth a question in a previous class before leaving, about the differences between a culture and a civilization, and I thought about this instantly that a culture may not always be civilized, but a civilization is just a culture that is more developed or advanced state and has rules. But he gave his views that most so-called civilizations are not really civilized as they were built on massacres but highlighted the fact that the Islamic civilization was the better out of them all, as the Islamic civilization was for everyone and did not discriminate.
- The Dr told us that the "Islamic civilization" does not mean the different countries that are Muslim and their culture, but it is a civilization with Islam in its essence regardless of culture
- The Dr showed us a video "1001 inventions..." which highlighted the fact that in the period known as the dark ages, it was actually the Islamic Golden Age
- *Reflection:* Although I am a Muslim, and more or less know about the Islamic achievement of Muslim scholars in history, especially during the middle ages, watching the video that the professor showed was very educational and highlighted some more scholars that I had not heard about, for example, about the Muslim doctor Al-Zahrawi who invented "Catgut" to be used for make stitches after medical surgery. This video further proved to me that the Muslims were innovators in the field that westerners now claim.

#### The human being is made using 5 components:
1) Fitra: came from fatara shay, how god created human in its original form (original nature) (how a human is in its originality), there are different perspectives of Fitra introduced by different groups:
	- For non-Muslims, there are multiple views.
	- For Muslims, there are 2 views, Classical and Modern views.
		- Predestination is the classical view
		- the following 2 are modern views:
			1) neutral (free will): it says that humans have tendency to do good or evil both
			2) positive fitrah (innate goodness): humans born good, but can choose to do anything (evil), i.e. without negative influences, the child will grow up to remain true to his Fitrah
2) Ruh (spirit): 
	- Engaged in a discussion with the Dr about the differences between the Ruh and Nafs. Ruh departs, but does not die, but the nafs dies.
	- There are 3 stages that the nafs can be in, nafs al lawama, nafs al mutmainna, and nafs al-ammarah, but the spirit will remain the same. IMO, we fluctuate between nafs al-ammarah and nafs al lawama

3) Aql (intellect):
	- It is the brain, where the decision are made
4) jasad (body):
	- The jasad is the whole thing.

## 25-06-2023
- The purpose of creation, tackled the questions who we are, why we are created, how, what should we do after we created? the answer to this question is islam
- Istikhlaf (khilafa) (vicegerent/stewardship): 
- The Dr explained us about satan and what 
- Dr emphasized that it is not Hawa's fault in doing anything, as man was created as a vicegerent on earth and meant to be sent there, he emphasized about women in Islam vs Christianity, and that 
- Dr stressed on the point of having sincerity of Niyyah or intention, it is important to have correct intention for proper worship, otherwise as the hadith of prophet about three people burning in hell, one was a fighter, an aalim etc. (need to see the reference/hadith). Ibn qayyim said, if satan came to block you from good deeds, u don't change your good deed, u change your intention. meaning don't stop, keep doing it and pray to Allah that he fixes your intention.

## 04-07-2023
- is the continuation of the previous lecture... 
- Ibtila (tribulation): testing, to see who is working hard, and the result of the test is the reward that the person will receive in the akhira
- there are two types of ibtila:
	- predestined ibtila: you are born with this, 
		- if it is a blessing, then we will give from that blessing, and thank God.
		- If test is a hardship, then just need to remain patient
	- assigned ibtila:
		- follow the guidance of god of what is right and wrong.
- human reactions to ibtila is the good Muslim, the sad Muslim, and the disbeliever
- We observe that something in ibtila is that when hardship comes some disbelievers commit suicide or just be sad, but we as muslims take it as a test, and know that if we endure, then we will get our reward
- Ikhtalaf (diversity): ,there are two types:
	- predestined: you don't have the choice of diversity
	- assigned: how you react to that choice, what do you do with that diversity? u become a racist if you are white?
		- there is a ayah on this, and about that the best one is one who is righteous
- Contemplation: 
- part 1 completed

***Now we know what the "human" was, now part 2, "the message"***

- Religion: why do humans need it? there are 4 reasons: 
	1) firstly there is already the Fitra, that is pushing you towards god, it is how god created you, 
	2) then there is the intellectual need, that it answers all the questions that a person has about nature and different things, 
	3) then there is a spiritual need that people feel at ease whenever they feel conflicted inside the universe, 
	4) fourth point is the liberating force and makes us ponder about 

man the unknown by alex, man always wants to know about the unknown, when we read tomorrow, we will grow, our mind grows, so we keep learning, 

- why does society need it? keeps check on people about rules, and imposes same values and vision for all people 
- characteristics of Islam: there are 16 that will cover
	- Rabbaniyyah: main characteristic of Islam is that it is divine (not distorted), revealed by God, and we have to please God

## 06-07-2023
What makes Islamic culture? It is as following
- sources of Islamic culture (and legislation):
	- direct sources: Quran, sunnah, sirah
	- indirect sources (human contributions other than the quran and sunnah): ijma, qiyas, etc.

- If the command is given in Quran, there is no need to go to any other source.
- There are so many tafasirs of the Quran, because of the presence of ayahs that are Qatee'ul dilaalah (can have many interpretations) as opposed to qatee' ul sabooth (source is undoubtful/its confirmed from God).
- Qatee'ul dilalaah is why we go to other interpretations such as the Sunnah etc.

- there is many debate among scholars on the other sources other than Quran and Sunnah, about what is legitimate or not. As we have seen that there are different schools of thought that interpret the hadith as being literal which are called maqaasid, while there are other that look at the general idea or aim of the hadith.

- reflection: talked and understood about different things that may or may not be allowed in Islam at length. 

## 09-07-2023
- Continuation of previous lecture...
- Sunnah: it comes as a clarification of the Quran, explains the techniques of prayer, and acts of charity
	- We cannot say that the Quran has everything, for example, the performance of prayer was told through the sunnah, and it is not in the Quran
	- Quraniyoon that say that they do not need the sunnah, that say that the Quran has everything and ignore all of sunnah, which is wrong because the explanations of the ibadaat is only told in the sunnah, such as the acts of hajj and prayer, 
	- so we should take both as references
- Sunnah is divided into 2, but all are revealed by god:
	- hadith qudsi: actual words of god exactly similar to the Quran
	- hadith nabwi: words of prophet Muhammad, action or silent approval
	- hadith are not preserved perfectly, as some can be weak because of the chain of narrators or the actual wording of the hadith is not legible. Because of this system of ahadith being categorized, orientalists are taken aback because of this structure in islam, and cannot attack this point.
	- Even more stronger hadith are that a group narrates or confirms called hadith al-mutwaatir as opposed to hadith al ahaad which is narrated by only one person, so can be easily considered weak when there is a contradiction.
- Sirah: prophets life journey/biography, starting from his birth
	- it is unique in many aspects
	- There are many sources of this as well
	- 

- Professor had a lengthy discussion with the class about the ahadith and where to put a boundary of what must be compulsory and what we can not do if we do not want to do it

## 11-07-2023
- Previous lecture was about sources of Islamic culture, this lecture is about foundations of Islamic culture.
- 4 evidence of Gods existence:
	- Nature: our fitrah leans us towards seeking help from god 
		- Example: when people were at sea, they encountered a difficult situation, so they prayed to god
	- Causation: something must cause something to exist, cannot come from nothing
	- universe: we can say the creations in nature
	- guidance: guidance was given to us
- Tawhid: oneness of God
	- Allah's godhood (tawhid al-uluiya): this aspect is what the kuffars rejected because even though they believed in Gods divinity, but they worshipped or communicated to him through idols or people.
	- Gods attributes: Imam Malik was asked how god "sat" on his throne, but it is pointless in thinking about it because we cannot grasp it, so we should not think about it.

- Regarding the evidence of Fitrah in God's existence, the Prof told us a story about his friend who was an atheist where he was with his other friend, where their car stopped between the intersection of a train track, and they say the train approaching, and they shouted for god's assistance, and the professors friends reminded him that he was calling for god's assistance despite him being an atheist, and this is the Fitrah of the human. 
- prof showed us a video about causation, where a man explained that nothing can come by itself, such as the assembling of a car by itself.
- 5 special messengers:
	- Moses
	- Jesus
	- Muhammad
	- Nuh
	- Ibraheem

## 13-07-2023
Continuing from previous lecture...
- The professor was telling a story about prophet Nuh and when he went to preach to people, the professor covered his ears and asked us what he literally did, and after some time when we did not figure it out, he showed us that the people covered their ears with their fingers and covered their faces, but he never gave up in any adversary

## 16-07-2023
Continuing from previous lecture...
- Now about "the acts of worship" in Islamic culture:
	- Shahadah: important not only to say it, but also to act upon it, otherwise like hypocrite, for example, to be solid, people threw alcohol on command and women wore any cloth for scarves
	- Salah: literally means "link" from silah, or link between God, Muslims should be punctual in their prayer to show that they love Him : prof said that It also teaches us about the concept of equality where in a line of prayer, there can be people with significantly different social status or race
	- Sawm: it teaches us that we are in control, if we are controlling ourselves from eating halal things, this proves that we can control ourselves from haram things as well
	- Zakat: 2.5% of savings per year, asked a question on whether Zakat should be payed on debt, so should not be payed if saving on debt, but should be payed if you are saving for any personal reason, also since our family does agriculture, asked professor whether paying the agriculture Zakat is necessary or they can also pay 2.5% from savings, so prof said we should pay the agriculture Zakat.
	- Hajj: once in a lifetime, also teaches us about equality, can see everyone here, regardless of social status or race, 
- The scheme of life in Islam: 
	- purpose of Sharia: protects the 5 necessities, anything that harm any of these 5 are Haram.
	- First thing is preventing the opposition, but to do something better, we can a positive thing.


## 20-07-2023
***Starting Part 3, "The Ummah":***
- What is the Ummah?
	- The Ummah consists of all the Muslims of the world, not any specific group or organization.
	- Ummah is not defined by the land and the rule, but instead the faith and mission, who have a single identity as opposed to a state which can house multiple identities.
	- There are 4 characteristics of the ummah.
	- Identity: it is the variety that distinguishes the individual from others, 
		- prof showed us different pictures of places and symbols and discussed that each one shows an identity
		- So like this, there are human symbols, place symbols, times symbols, and expressive symbols for identity
		- So a person has identities in levels, which starts from the locality, then country, then the region identity, then the Ummah identity
		- problem is when those identities are in conflict, for example country identity is different from ummah identity


## 23-07-2023
Qaradawis: the attitude of how muslims react to Islam ???????????
1) wish to make Islam westernized, where they feel the west is superior and adopt and change Islam to fit western standards
2) then some people are "living in the past", where they feel that Islam was perfect only 1400 years ago, and adopting new things are useless, but this is not the case, yes we should be proud of our history, but also be adopting things that are beneficial to us.
3) then there are the "apologetic", people who live in the west but cannot defend it, they try to find a way out by accusing themselves, instead of taking an offensive by telling what actually Islam is, we don't have to think like this, because even I don't know the Hikmah of things, but accept them as they are because God said so
4) then there is the "arrogant", Muslims feel that they are the best, and do not need anyone else, and not benefit from anyone
5) then the "incomplete", they see part of Islam and leave the rest, like they are lazy, like they are happy with worshipping aspects, but not the Dunya aspects, they don't want to it to interfere in that part for them, but only as an Ibada, and like if they will see any Zulm in society, they don't speak up
6) then the "aggressive", they proclaim that they only have the truth, and anyone else is false, professor gave an example on this that there is one truth, but the right approach could be multiple so he said if going to library, some may go by car, some by bus and some walk, but all are right as they are going to reach the same place, so to claim someone's claim in truth, and stating that everyone is wrong is wrong
7) This is the only proper one, din al wast, "civilizational (middle path)", live your life adapting a middle path, prof gave example about prophet doing this that people came aayisha to ask about his acts of worship, and once she told them, they concluded that they should do more than what the prophet did, but the prophet cleared this up by saying that he is the most god fearing, and people should follow his sunnah where he did everything in moderation, in another example prof said, that zainab had ropes tied to help her pray, but the prophet said that to remove them, and implied that people should do pray when they are active
