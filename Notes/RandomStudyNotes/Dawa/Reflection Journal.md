- In the intro lecture, where he explained the syllabus, the dr motivated the identity of Arabs and Muslims and briefly went over their achievements and what the westerners adopted from us in the field of education.
- An example is that the westerners adopted the practice of wearing a university gown and and cap, this was first introduced by Muslims in Al-Andalus where they used to wear a bisht to symbolize an achievement and tied a Quran on their heads to symbolize that God is watching over them.
- Cultures are different from one place to another, when Imam Shafi came to Egypt he saw a different culture so changed about 60% of his teachings when he went from Iraq to Egypt.
- Also motivated to us the fact that having no guidance (i.e. the Quran) puts no boundaries on what humans are and are not allowed to do, which leads to humans committing atrocities, for example, The American bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

- Dr Zakaryya got all the students to introduce their countries and their cultures in detail, to get more of a feeling for this day's lecture, which was about culture of humans, which is basically a process of collection of habits which is added though interactions, behaviors which includes knowledge belief art law custom and is a product of a socialization process etc. The interaction with our classmates gave me an insight on different cultures such as the history and food of different people
- equality/frequency of patterns of people in a culture might variate, but all of the patterns will be the same.
- Culture is passed from one generation to another.
- branching off from the main discussion, when some students did not raise hands when the Dr asked to everyone with a show of hands on a question about multicultural society and a single cultural society, he encouraged us to live a balanced life, gave an example of a tafsir from Syed Qudb of the story of fishing on Saturday, that people that remain in the middle are lowest, and they are not worth mentioning in the Quran.
- Single culture societies are very strong as it is clear what their identity is, there is a mainstream idea on the culture, and if someone outside wants to come, he must adopt that places culture, for example Qatar. Multi-cultural societies are very difficult to manage, but good thing is that they are very tolerant, otherwise they will be termed racist, for example, UK. If someone outside wants to come, he can be flexible with the culture. 
- The Dr set forth a question at the end of class about whether is there a difference between culture and civilization

- Dr set forth a question in the previous class before leaving, that what was the difference between culture and civilization, and I thought about this instantly that a culture may not always be civilized, but the fact was that a civilization was just a culture that is more developed or advanced state and has rules. But he gave his views that most so-called civilizations are not really civilized as they were built on massacres but highlighted the fact the Islamic civilization was the better out of them all, as the Islamic civilization was for everyone and did not discriminate
- The Dr told us that the "Islamic civilization" does not mean the different countries that are Muslim and their culture, but it is a civilization with Islam in its essence regardless of culture
- The Dr showed us a video "1001 inventions..." that highlighted the fact that in the period known as the dark ages, it was actually the Islamic Golden Age
#### The human being is made using 5 components:
1) Fitra: came from fatara shay, how god created human in its original form (original nature) (how a human is in its originality), there are different perspectives of Fitra introduced by different groups:
	- For non-Muslims, there are multiple views.
	- For Muslims, there are 2 views, Classical and Modern views.
		- Predestination is the classical view
		- the following 2 are modern views:
			1) neutral (free will): it says that humans have tendency to do good or evil both
			2) positive fitrah (innate goodness): humans born good, but can choose to do anything
2) Ruh (spirit): 
	- Engaged in a discussion with the Dr about the differences between the Ruh and Nafs. Ruh departs, but does not die, but the soul (nafs) dies.
	- There are 3 stages that the nafs can be in, nafs al lawama, nafs al mutmainna, and one more, but the spirit will remain the same.

3) Aql (intellect):
	- It is the brain, where the decision are made
4) jasad (body):
	- The jasad is the whole thing.

- The purpose of creation, tackled the questions who we are, why we are created, how, what should we do after we created? the answer to this question is islam
- Istikhlaf (khilafa) (vicegerent/stewardship): 
- The Dr explained us about satan and what 
- Dr emphasized that it is not Hawa's fault in doing anything, as man was created as a vicegerent on earth and meant to be sent there, he emphasized about women in Islam vs Christianity, and that 
- Dr stressed on the point of having sincerity or Niyyah or intention, it is important to have correct intention for proper worship, otherwise as the hadith of prophet about three people burning in hell, one was a fighter, an aalim etc. (need to see the reference/hadith). Ibn qayyim said, if satan came to block you from good deeds, u don't change your good deed, u change your intention. meaning don't stop, keep doing it and pray to Allah that he fixes your intention.
