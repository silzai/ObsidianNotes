Documentary 1:
What were the strengths of Islamic civilization?
- The Islamic civilizations innovations in science, ingenious inventions and the ability to keep improving on things was it's biggest strength. The Islamic civilization kept improving and were innovators in inventions of any problem they faced, be it everyday life, or art and sciences. 
- As can be seen from them having a library where they translated Greek books to Arabic. 
- For example, when faced with the problem of time keeping and astrology, Muslims used an astrolabe to calculate the time of prayers and time to eat food.
- In those days in arts they made lusterware instead of using gold as it was not recommended for men which is using a paste made of clay and a compound of different metals. This allowed fabulous and shiny looking pottery to be made.

Documentary 2:
**Note down new points you learned, then explain why the Islamic perspective of Prophet Issa is so unique**:
- A Muslim cannot be a believer if he does not believe in Jesus
- Jesus holds a special place in Islam mentioned more than prophet Muhammad, 
- many famous stories in bible are also in Quran, many same characters of bible are also in  Quran, like Adam Zachariah Elias, salmon , David, john the Baptist, but their are nuanced versions of these stories.
- God says in Quran that the Quran has not come to cancel the previous scriptures of the past
- story changes after birth of Isa, in Quran relative to the bible. Mary is limited to passive role in bible. After conceiving Jesus, there is person such as joseph for protection, she is alone, with a physical burden under a date tree in the desert, but then when she conceived, God helped her by giving her water, then when she went back, the angel imposed silence on her, but the people shamed her, then she points to the child, and the baby talks which is not in the bible, the Quran narrates the story of Mary as a rightful lady and in detail, she is seen as the ultimate model of perfect balance according to hamza Yusuf, Mary seen as a symbol of purity for Muslim women
- 
- fundamental of Christianity is Jesus is death and resurrection, Islam denies that, and say that was brought above on the heavens by angels
- Christianity has anti-Christ, that goes against the teachings of Christ. Islam has dajjal similar to that, but Dajjal has one eye, then when Jesus comes back to earth, he will say to the Christians to follow God
- Quran tells all to think about all the realities we have, be it the reality of religion or anything else
