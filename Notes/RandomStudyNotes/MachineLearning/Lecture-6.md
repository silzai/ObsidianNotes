# kNN
## Measures:
- Distance
- Similarity Between Binary Vectors 
# Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
## Steps:
1) compute probabilities of classes
2) compute probabilities of given feature given that class
3) now, can throw away the training dataset, we don't need it since we calculated the probabilities, and we only need that
4) To avoid 0 probabilities, will do Laplace correction, in which we add 1 to each numerator and $k$ which is the number of features to the denominator
5) To avoid "numerical underflow" which is the computer not being able to represent very small numbers, so to solve, will transform all the probabilities to $log$ and do summation in the formula instead of multiplying
