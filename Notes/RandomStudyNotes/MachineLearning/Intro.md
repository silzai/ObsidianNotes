- ML comes under AI
- traditional programming
	- explicitly create the functions ourselves by telling the computer what to do
	- Program = {f1, f2, f3, ..., fn}
- Machine Learning Programming
	- ML = {}
	- no explicit implementation of the functions
	- We do this because coding some functions is very hard to develop by humans, for example, write a function to distinguish different animals,
		- what will happen if give another angle of a picture of a cat?
	- So we want the machine learning function to produce this function for us
	- Labeled Data -> ML algorithm -> $f$
- Goal:
	- To create an ML algorithm to create f or model
	- How to fine tune $f$
	- Will implement some algorithms, also use external libraries for higher level algorithms
- Supervised Learning
	- learning from labeled data
- Unsupervised Learning
	- clustering input data 

- Working with data:
	- pandas
	- numpy
	- matplot lib
- Classification
- Regression
- Neural Networks
- Clustering
