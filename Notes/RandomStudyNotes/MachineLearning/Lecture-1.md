# Contents:
1) EDA
2) data preprocessing
3) Supervised Learning
	- classification
		- the labels/objects we pass are enumerable 
	- regression
		- if the labels/objects are continuous values:
			- Linear regression
			- Logistic regression
	- Decision Tree and Random Forest
	- Convolutional Neural Network
4) Unsupervised Learning:
	- clustering:
		- Centroid based:
			- Kmeans
			- Kmeans++
			- Kmedoids
		- Connectivity based:
			- Hierarchical Clustering
