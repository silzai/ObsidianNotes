- Supervised Learning
	- classification
		- the labels/objects we pass are enumerable 
	- regression
		- if the labels/objects are continuous values:
			- Linear regression
			- Logistic regression
	- Decision Tree and Random Forest
	- Convulational Neural Network
- Unsupervised Learning:
	- clustering:
		- Centroid based:
			- Kmeans
			- Kmeans++
			- Kmedoids
		- Connectivity based:
			- Hierarchical Clustering
