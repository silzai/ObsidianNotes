- We put metadata in the html `<head>` tag
- inline tags:
	- doesn't have endline, so we have to use `<br>` break tag which means new line
- `<ul>` unordered list, and `<ol>` is ordered list, can have properties such as `type` 
	- `<li>`: list item
- `<img src="" height="" width="" alt="">`
- `<a href="">` anchor tag
- `<hr>` horizontal row, its just a straight line

# Semantic tags
- they have no effect on the structure
- they just help the developer and the browser to scan/read the website easily

# Inline and Block elements
- inline: this tag continues on the same line, there is no new line 
- block level element: always starts on a new line
