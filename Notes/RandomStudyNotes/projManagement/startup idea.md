- forum: satellite town planner
	- short description: A lot of developing countries have bad town planning or no planning at all which leads to congested or narrow roads and house locations, vehicle parking, and most of the time no access for emergency vehicles and normal transportation or utilities, that is why the "satellite town planner" will use AI/ML models to redraw/re-structure the town/area to conform to standards for safety, ease-of-living and ease-of-transportation and the environment.
		- offering: It is a web app and on the main page of the user interface, a satellite view of the earth will be shown, and the client will select the area on the earth where the town needs to be re-planned, and the the web app will return another map of a properly standardized town with standards on road width, house and parking placements (with the house of the same size as was initially in the old map), green-belt placements, and the piping and electricity layout.
