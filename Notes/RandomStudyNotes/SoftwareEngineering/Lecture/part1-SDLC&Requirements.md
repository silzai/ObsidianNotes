# SDLC: Waterfall
## 1) requirements analysis (elicitation) (IEEE uses the term SRS (software requirements specification))
- specifications
- Use-case models, data flow diagrams
- conceptual domain models
- Functional requirements:
	- specify the inputs and outputs
	- ==will use text by using the word "shall" before any verb==
- Non-functional requirements:
	- are measurable and testable

- Techniques for requirements Elicitation (functional requirements i.e. use cases):
	- Brainstorming
		- Arrange the attendees around a table 
		- Decide on a ‘trigger question’ 
		- Ask each participant to write an answer and pass the paper to its neighbor
	- Prototyping 
		- The simplest kind: paper prototype
		- The most common: a mock-up of the system’s user interface (UI) (Balsamiq or Figma)
	- Scenario
		- real-life examples of how a system can be used
	- Domain analysis
		- We need "domain experts" and communicate with them, and document what they are saying
	- Observation
	- Interviewing
	- Note: Scope of the system should be determined, and will need to ignore some requirements by the client that are not in the scope of the system
## 2) design: the solution, the features of the software (software design description)
- There are 2 parts: high-level design and detailed design
- UML diagrams (minus use-case diagrams)
	- Class diagrams
	- Package diagrams
	- component diagrams
	- deployment diagrams
- database design
- UI design
- will use diagrams and text 
## 3) implementation: coding
## 4) testing
- Create 2 docs, software test plan, software test document (detailed) specifies all test cases, software test report (requirements passed or failed)
- White-box testing
- black-box testing
## 5) maintenance
