- **non-functional requirements:** reliability, stability, security, etc. (all should be quantized)
- **round trip programming:** a functionality of [software development tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_tools "Software development tools") that synchronizes two or more related software artifacts, such as, source code, [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model_(computer_science) "Conceptual model (computer science)")s, configuration files, documentation, etc. between each other. Used to conform versions of software.
- **technical debt:** happens when there is no planning initially during design stage, in the long term, maybe we have working software, but when we want to add new feature then will be difficult, because they didn't think of it in advance. Can occur when teams start programming straight away without thinking about the design.
- **mockup tool:** mockup is a static design of a web page or application that features many of its final design elements but is not functional, it may also include placeholder data.
