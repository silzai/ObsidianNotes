 - These are called interaction overviews
 - shows dynamic execution between objects
 - Show sequence of execution for use cases
 - 
 dashed lines to show return value
- activation box--> boxes in the diagram
- lifeline--> dashed line from the classes
- event occurrence-->straight line from 1 activation box to other activation box
- no description--> no understanding ;)
# Operators
- we can use loop frames/fragments in visual paradigm to show a loop and alt (alt = if then..., loop: while loop for loop).
- ref: reference to another sequence diagram to simplify the diagram
- par: parallel fragment shows concurrent processes

- can use either boundary or controller object to show the object that is interacted by the user 

- Can use "container" object to store a list of those container objects, and we will do a `findThing()` to search/update for the `thing`.
