 dashed lines to show return value
- activation box--> boxes in the diagram
- lifeline--> dashed line from the classes
- event occurrence-->straight line from 1 activation box to other activation box
- no description--> no understanding ;)
- we can use loop fragments in visual paradigm to show a loop and alt (alt = if then...., loop: while loop for loop).
