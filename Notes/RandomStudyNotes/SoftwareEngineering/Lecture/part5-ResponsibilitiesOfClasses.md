- Need to assign responsibilities of classes correctly
	- if we assign responsibility correctly then coupling is minimized
	- 
- goal is to minimize coupling but maximize cohesion
- CK object oriented metrics
	- Defined 6 metrics on OOP, here are 2;
		1) LCOM: lack of cohesion of methods 
		2) CBM: Coupling between objects
			- e.g. if want to add an object to another object, then that object may need to instantiate a few other classes because 
- after these metrics, can see the quality of the design
- Responsibility Driven Design

- Coupling types:
	- attribute coupling (class x has an attribute of class y)
	- method coupling (object y is used anywhere in a class of x)
	- inheritance coupling (class x is a subclass of y)
	- interface coupling
