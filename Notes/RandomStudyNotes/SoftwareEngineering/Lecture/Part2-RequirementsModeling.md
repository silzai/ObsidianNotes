- This is not a design model, but a structure model
- SSADM = Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method
- one of the diagrams under this related to OOP, we use data flow diagrams (DFD).
- data flow diagram (DFD) are not a formal part of UML, but they can be used to complement UML diagrams and provide additional insight into system requirements and flow.
## Data Flow Diagrams
- It is about the flow of data, not the actual processes involved, so will abstract the processes in terms of the data only
- There are 4 symbols:
### 1) Processes: 
1) its a rounded rectangle
2) will start with a verb
3) Task or activity that can transform the data
4) The process ids show the order of Processes that are executed
- Rules that are not be violated:
	1) At least 1 input data flow
	2) At least 1 output data flow
	3) Only processes can communicate with data stores (2 data stores cannot communicate with each other)
### 2) External entities:
1) it is a rectangle
2) is a noun
3) can be a source or destination of data (person/machine/external system)
4) It resides outside the system
5) There should be a process between 2 external entities
### 3) Data Stores:
1) is a noun
### 4) Data Flow: 
1) is a noun
2) is an arrow 
3) 

Different models are used to show the system from different point of views:
- Use-case model is used to show the system from the customers point of view,
