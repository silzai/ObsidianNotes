# Software Life Cycle Processes Models
- There are 6 models:
	1) Waterfall Model
	2) Prototyping
	3) V-Model
	4) Spiral Model
	5) RUP
	6) Agile Processes

- Software process = SDLC (software development Life Cycle)
- Artifact:
	- SRS documents
	- use case diagrams
	- code (not necessarily source code)
# 1) Waterfall Model
- Has:
	- Milestones
	- Artifacts produced at the end of milestones
- SDLC:
	- has verification and validation:
		- i.e. building the right product vs building the product right
- feedback loop arrows used in case there are minor changes to the previous phase
# 2) Prototyping
- Make a prototype of the app first, and discuss that with the client
- can combine this with waterfall model in the initial design parts of waterfall model
# 3) V-Model
- There is no separate "verification and validation" (testing) phase as in waterfall, but the testing is done simultaneously 
# 4) Spiral Model
- 1 loop = 1 phase
- for each phase there is risk assessment
- Used for systems that have risk (idk what type)
# 5) Rational Unified Process (RUP)
- incremental/iterative process
- can see the process easily using the diagram in the slides
# 6) Agile
