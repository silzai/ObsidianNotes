# Initial Project Schedule
- Identify the activities and tasks: 
	- also called a **Work Breakdown Structure** (WBS)
	- WBS types:
		- Process based WBS
		- Product based WBS
			- what kind of components are included?
		- Hybrid WBS (both of above)
- identify the dependencies between the tasks
	- draw a dependency table

| Activity | Effort (person-days) | Duration (days) | Dependenies |
| -------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| T5       | 5                    | 10              | T2, T4 (M3)            |

>[!note] For the Dependency Table:
>- Here, the effort is less than duraiton, this means the people assinged are not working full time
>- if effor exceeds duration, then this means more people are working on the activity
- Will make a activity on node dependency graph using the dependency table, so we can find out the earliest/latest start and finish times.

- Identify key milestones
- Identify the duration of work
- Identify the critical paths and slack times of non-critical paths

# Critical Paths
- If this is delayed, then whole project will be delayed
- Critical path is the longest duration path, cann
- Slack time = 0 for activities in critical paths
>[!information] Slack Time
>maximum amount of time a activity can be delayed, and still finish the project in the shortest time possible

# Gantt Chart
- Bar:
	- length represents the total time
	- color fill shows progress of the activity
- Diamond:
	- A milestone is represented by a diamond
