Actors:
	- can be a person
	- can be a subsystem (that may not directly communicate with the system but is connected through another actor such as a person)
	- The system itself cannot be an actor in the system

Use-case:
	- Should start with a verb
	- If do not know whether to generalize/make use-case abstract, or make separate use-cases, can think of it like this: if we a single user interface, and if all the work is being done inside it easily (with minor changes even) then we can generalize that use-case and put it as one use-case.
