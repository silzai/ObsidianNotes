>[!warning] Alif
>No word can start with an Alif (since it is just a long vowel, not a حرف (see below to see what a حرف is), Alif can either come in between or at the end of a word.
- So a word always starts with either a هَمْزَة الوَصَل or هَمْزَةُ الْقَطَع.
- The letter that seems like an Alif at the start of a word is actually a هَمْزَة الوَصَل.
# Hamzatul-wasl (هَمْزَة الوَصَلْ): 
- shape: ا
- There are only ten nouns in the Arabic language that start with this. (not joking)
- If this Hamza comes in the middle of sentence, then it is silent or ignored and is not read.
- For example, one of the ten nouns is the word اسم, then و اسمي will be read with the ا ignored, like وسمي.
# Hamzatul-Qata\`a (هَمْزَةُ الْقَطَع):
- shape: أ
- Hamzatul-Qata\`a is always read irrespective of its location.
___
# Also
- all imperative forms of verbs of (sometimes 3,) 5 and 6 letters have the Hamzatul-wasl, aside from these the Hamzatul-Qata\`a remains 

>[!info] Definition of حرف:
 If a word starts with somewhere in the mouth, it is only then considered a حرف, the long vowels ا, و, and ي are not حرف since they do not "start" from somewhere in the mouth, but just end from the continuation of other letters.
