- To connect two verbs, we need to use the harf "ان", for example:
	- ماذا تحب ان تشرب؟
- Here we used ان to connect two verbs. 
- Another example, where we answer the previous question:
	- انا احب ان اشرب ماء

>There are two types of sentences in Arabic
>1) جملة اسمية (nominal sentences)
>2) جملة فعلية (verbal sentences)
# Nominal Sentences (جملة اسمية)
- Nominal sentences always start with a noun called مبتدأ
- مبتدأ (subject) means starter, or the noun that we use to start the sentence 
- It doesn't matter what comes after the noun (i.e. the خبر (predicate) or what's happening to the noun)
- For example:
	- الطلاب في الصف
	- انا باكستاني
	- هذا كتاب
- Here, since all 3 sentences start with a noun (or pronoun/demonstrative pronoun), so these are nominal sentences
- its more stronger than verbal sentence, because there is more emphasis, and those sentences that do not change are written as nominal sentences. (idk what this means)
# Verbal Sentences (جملة فعلية)

>[!note] Negating Verbs
>We use لا to negate verbs in present tense and also to negate imperative verbs (commands), for example:
>- لا اريد قهوة (present tense verb)
>- لا تأكل الطعام (command)
