- To connect two verbs, we need to use the harf "ان", for example:
	- ماذا تحب ان تشرب؟
- Here we used ان to connect two verbs. 
- Another example, where we answer the previous question:
	- انا احب ان اشرب ماء

>There are two types of sentences in Arabic
>1) جملة اسمية (nominal sentences)
>2) جملة فعلية (verbal sentences)
# Nominal Sentences (جملة اسمية)
- Nominal sentences always start with a noun called مبتدأ
- مبتدأ (subject) means starter, or the noun that we use to start the sentence 
- It doesn't matter what comes after the noun (i.e. the خبر (predicate) or what's happening to the noun)
- For example:
	- الطلاب في الصف
	- انا باكستاني
	- هذا كتاب
- Here, since all 3 sentences start with a noun (or pronoun/demonstrative pronoun), so these are nominal sentences
>[!information] Nominal VS Verbal Sentences
>Nominal sentences are more stronger than verbal sentence, because there is more emphasis on the noun at the start, and those sentences that do not change are written as nominal sentences. (idk what this means)
# Verbal Sentences (جملة فعلية)
- All verbal sentences verbs start as singular, so if I have a nominal sentence:
>الاولاد يتناولون الفطور
- So, when changing it to a verbal sentence, the verb will become singular like this:
> يتناول الاولاد الفطور

>[!note] Negating Verbs
>We use لا to negate verbs in present tense and also to negate imperative verbs (commands), for example:
>- لا اريد قهوة (present tense verb)
>- لا تأكل الطعام (command)
