# There are 3 types of plurals:
## 1) Sound masculine plural (جَمعُ مُذَكَّر سَالِمٍ)
- It is for male humans only
- just add ون or ين at the end, for example, مسلم will become مسلمون
- add "oon" or "een" depends on the grammatical roles of words by slightly changing their endings.
## 2) Sound feminine plural (جَمعُ مُؤَنَّثِ سَالِمٍ)
- It is for female singulars (words that have ة at the end)
- just add ات at the end, for example, مسلمة will become مسلمات
## 3) Broken plural (جَمعُ تَكسِير)
- It has no rule of making the plural from the singular
- we just have to memorize it
- It is called like this because the original singular work is broken and more letters are added in between the singular to form the plural.
