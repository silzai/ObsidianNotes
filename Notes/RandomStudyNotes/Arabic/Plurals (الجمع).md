# There are 3 types of plurals:
## 1) Sound masculine plural
- It is for male humans only
- just add ون at the end, for example, مسلم will become مسلمون
## 2) Sound feminine plural
- It is for female singulars (words that have ة at the end)
- just add ات at the end, for example, مسلمة will become مسلمات
## 3) Broken plural
- It has no rule of making the plural from the singular
- we just have to memorize it
- It is called like this because the original singular work is broken and more letters are added in between the singular to form the plural.
