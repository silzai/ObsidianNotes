# Related Works
- Related works in terms of the literature that we went through to research different solutions that were created to solve the problem of plant disease detection 
	- YOLO: is a image classification and object detection model
		- disadvantage: will have to make bounding boxes to create a dataset, too time consuming
	- KG: uses RAG but stores data as a knowledge graph instead of indexing it normally
# Application details
- next we will go into the technical details of our application by showing you some diagrams and the design of our implementation 
- 
# dataset curation
- Further, we will talk about dataset curation which is of immense importance to any machine learning app
	- wanted to bring out the fact that curating a dataset is a very big challenge and this will require much work from us as LLMs need a lot of data to perform well as there are many layers of neural networks to train on
	- the process requires scraping the web, and converting the unstructured data to a structured representation so we can train the model or do RAG
	- here are a few examples of some already curated datasets
	- and these are just some examples of tomato images  
# Assumptions
- and then we will talk about some assumptions that need to be satisfied in order to accomplish our tasks while developing the app
