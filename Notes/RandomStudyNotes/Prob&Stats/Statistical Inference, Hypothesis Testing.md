- will set up the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ to the thing that we want to show with strong evidence.
- acceptance region will be given
- find the type1 error: $H_0$ is true and you are rejecting it, its probability is $\alpha$
- find the type2 error: $H_0$ is false and you are accepting it, its probability is $\beta$
- 1 - $\beta$ is the power of the test. will be null hypothesis is false and we are rejecting it.

- rejecting region is called critical region


- for 1 sided p-value is the probability that is the alpha that will be at border of acceptance/rejection. it will be $1-F(z_0)$
- for 2 sided p value $2\times (1-F(|z_0|))$
