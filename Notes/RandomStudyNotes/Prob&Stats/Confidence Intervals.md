- 2 random variables, one based on z and other on t based confidence intervals
- if we know that it is normal distribution, then will use z based interval
- otherwise if it is estimate/unknown then we will use t based
- reading t table will give read that probabilies to the right hand side (right tail) of t value.
# how to construct CIs
- If we know $\sigma$ then just go for z-based CI otherwise t-based
- constructing a 95% two sided Ci
- $\alpha/2$ 

if sample size increases, then confidence interval will decrease
