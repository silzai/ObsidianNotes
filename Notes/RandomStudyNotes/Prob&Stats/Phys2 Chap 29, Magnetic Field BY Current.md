# 29.1, Biot-Savart law:
- Original formula for magnetic field in current carrying wire:
$$ \vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi}\int\frac{d\vec{s}\times r}{r^2} $$

## For magnetic field due to short-wire:
- Formula for magnetic field in short current carrying wire at point P above the wire:
$$ \vec{B} =\frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi a}(sin\theta - sin\theta) $$
$where,\space a =length\space from \space wire \space to \space P$
## For magnetic field due to long wire:
- Formula for magnetic field in long current carrying wire:
$$ \vec{B} =\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi a} $$

## For magnetic field due to curved wire segment:
- Formula for magnetic field at point O which is junction of the two tangents of curved wire:
$$ \vec{B} =\frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi a}\theta $$

## For magnetic field on the axis of a circular loop:
- Formula for magnetic field along the center axis of a loop at point P away from the center:
$$ \vec{B} =\frac{\mu_0 Ia^2}{2(a^2+x^2)^{\frac32}} $$
$where,$
$a = radius\space of \space loop$
$x=distance\space from\space center \space of \space loop \space to \space P$

- If point P was at the center inside the loop, then magnetic field is:
$$ \vec{B} =\frac{\mu_0 I}{2 a} $$
- if point P was far away from the loop on the axis (x >> a): 
$$ \vec{B} =\frac{\mu_0 }{2 \pi}\frac{\mu}{x^3} $$
# 29.2, Magnetic Force Between Parallel Conductors:
$$\frac{F_B}{l}=\frac{\mu_0I_1I_2}{2\pi a}$$
# 29.3, Amperes Law:
$$\int\vec{B}d\vec{s}=\mu_0I$$
$where,$
$d\vec{s} = path \space of \space the \space loop\space formed \space by \space magnetic \space field$
# 29.4, Magnetic Field By Toroid:
- Magnetic field created between the coils at a distance r from the center:
$$ \vec{B} =\frac{\mu_0 NI}{2 \pi r} $$
$where,$
$N = number\space of \space turns$

## Magnetic Field By Solenoid:
$$ \vec{B} ={\mu_0 nI} $$
$where,$
$n = number \space of \space turns \space per\space length \space l$
# 29.5,  Gauss' law In Magnetism:
$$ \phi_B =\int \vec{B}d\vec{A} $$
