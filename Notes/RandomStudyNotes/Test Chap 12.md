> *Oxidation number/state:*
> is defined as the apparent charge, positive or negative, which an element would have in a compound.

1) Calculate the oxidation number of $Cr$ in $K_2Cr_2O_7$

2) What is the oxidation state of $S$ in $SO_4^{-2}$ ion

> *Balancing Equations (i.e. equation is balanced when: charges on  LHS = charges on RHS)*
> 
> 1) Redox (Oxidation Number) Method: In any redox reaction, the total number of electrons lost by one element must be equal to the total number of electrons gained by another element.
> 
> 2) Ion Electron (Half Reaction) Method: Divide the reaction into separate oxidation and reduction half reactions, then balance the half-reactions one at a time and combine them, so that electrons are neither created nor destroyed in the reaction.

3) Balance the following equation by oxidation number method: $$P + HNO_3 + H_2O → H_3PO_4 + NO$$
4) Balance the following equation by half reaction method: $$Cr_2O_7^{-2} + H_2SO_3 → Cr^{+3} + HSO_4^-$$
> *Galvanic cell:*
> An electrochemical cell in which spontaneous redox reactions produces an electric current is know as galvanic or voltaic cell.

5) In a Galvanic cell consisting of a $Cu$ cathode and $Zn$ anode:
	- Write the oxidation half-reaction.
	- Write the reduction half-reaction
	- Write the overall cell reaction.
	- Define the roll of the salt bridge in this cell with an example.

> *Cell Potential ($E\degree_{cell}$ ):*
> The Force with which electrons are pushed through wire from anode to cathode is called the electromotive force (emf) measured in Volts.
> The emf produced by galvanic cell is called cell potential ($E\degree_{cell}$ )

>  $E\degree_{cell} = E\degree_{cathode} - E\degree_{anode}$
> 	- where $E\degree_{cathode/anode}$ = electrode potential
>  However, electrode (half-cell) potential cannot be measured directly, but relative half-cell potential can be determined by coupling it with a **standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)**
>So, *Electrode Potential:*
>	is defined as the tendency of a half-cell reaction to undergo reduction relative to the SHE.

6) Define the Standard Hydrogen Electrode and write down its oxidation reactions at cathode and anode.
7) Calculate $E\degree_{cell}$ for a $Zn$ and $Cu$ cell and write the cell reactions, also show the direction of electron flow.

> *Activity series of metals:*
> It is a list of metals. Metals higher on the list transfer electrons to metal cations lower on the list. The greater the separation between the species the more vigorous will b e the reaction.

8) What happens when:
	- iron pellets are added to a solution of $MgCl_2$?
	- Aluminum is dipped in hot water.

9) In one line, define electrolysis and electrolytic cells.

>$m \propto Q$, or:     
>$m = Z\times I\times t$
>	where: $m$ = mass of deposited in grams
>				$Z$  = electro chemical equivalent
>				$I$ = current in $A$
>				$t$ = time of electrolysis in seconds

10) In the electrolysis of molten $ZnCl_2$, how much $Zn$ can be deposited at the cathode by passage of $0.01 A$ current for one hour?

11) List the types of batteries with examples.

12) Define Corrosion with the half-reactions.
13) List the preventions of corrosion with examples.
