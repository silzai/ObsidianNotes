- recursion; base case
# types of complete search
- subsets are found using recursion, by a function either including or discluding an element, example question, super lucky number https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/96/B
but did not understand the question, but answer is same way as above
- permutations; can be done using itertools in python (but this is not for practise, just for knowledge)
- backtracking: pruning and backtracking the recursive tree, example nqueens: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1624
