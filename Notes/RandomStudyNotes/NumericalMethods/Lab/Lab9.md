- Interpolating using built-in function in 3 dimensions:
- `zi = interp2(x, y, z ,xi, yi, 'method')`
	- `interp2` is a table of input values
	- so will z values will be (size(x))^2

- Use built-in functions to find integration using `trapz(x, y)` or `cumtrapz(x, y)` by having a range of x values, and finding y values by inputting the x value in an equation that is equal to y
