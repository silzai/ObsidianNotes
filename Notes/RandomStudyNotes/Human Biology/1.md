- structure:
	- different units and components
	- cell -> tissue -> 
- function:
	- how the above coordinate with each other to perform different functions
# science
3 elements of science:
1) matter or energy
2) should be based on experiences and 
3) empirical thought: fundamental of science, built upon  
- biology:
	- composed of living things, that are also matter and energy
	- organs are matter, and they are connected through energy
	- what is alive?
		- *its written on slide about "what characteristics are shared by living organisms"*
		- anything that has cells
		- anything that reproduces
		- anything that has growth
		- anything that can take energy
		- adaptation to environment
		- homeostasis
		- why do we die?
			- cells lose capacity to process energy because they build upon themselves layers
	- autotrophs and heterotrophs are differentiated from the source of food
	- packed energy and molecules: glucose -> this may convert to proteins, starch, etc.
	- heterotrophs eat that glucose, and they break it, and that energy is used by that heterotrophs
	- autotrophs take inorganic source of carbon
	- heterotrophs take organic source of carbon
		- (organic is something related to something alive)
	- adaptation is changing the characteristic of species, evolution is making new species by way of adaptation
	- environment provides a stimulus to the genes
	
# how are living things classified?
- autotrophs
- heterotrophs
- in taxonomic point of view, we have put 
- Domains
	- Prokaryotes:
		- both bacteria and archaea do not have a nucleus, so called prokaryotes
		- Bacteria
		- Archaea: uni-cellular, similair to bacteria but different cell membrane is strong so can survive in boiling water/extreme cold/acid (also called extremophiles)
	
	- Eukaryotes: with nucleus
# scientific method
- anything that we want to contribute to science, then we will have to follow the scientific method that is applicable to any discipline in science
- steps of the scientific method:
	- start with an observation
	- develop a hypothesis
	- perform experiments
	- collect and analyze data
	- develop conclusion
- if we have two findings then we perform a t-test and if the p value is strictly less than 0.05 (if it is equal then still reject) then we retain our hypothesis 
# infectious diseases
- infectious disease: one that travels from one to another
	- our body develops resistance/immunity to previous diseases but when something new comes then our body is not prepared and consequences are worse
	- no one knows how covid-19 came
