# Cell theory
- basic unit of life
- new cells are made from pre-existing cells
- why dont bigger animals have bigger cells?
	- our dominant functions is absorption and for absorption the surface area is very important, 
	- all processes are based on absorption, for example stomach lining has larger surface area to absorb nutrients faster
# cell membrane
- has semi/selectively-permeable layer:
	- SLIDE TOPIC 3.3
	- permites $H_2O$, glyecerol, urea, ethanol, 
	- but rejects macromolecules and ions such as sodium, potassium, hytdroge, calcium, chlorine
- the cell membrane maintains connection with the blood our surrounding in our body
- protien acts as a gate and facilitates movement of things to and from the cell
- the process of moving through plasma membrane:
	- passive transport: happens naturally without needing energy
		- does not need energy because doing it along the gradient
		- diffusion and osmosis
			- hypertonic: more solute outside the cell, so flow of $H_2O$ will be from cell to outside
	- active transport: requires energy
		- requires energy because doing it against the gradient
		- there is expenditure of ATP to expel molecules: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) isÂ **the source of energy for use and storage at the cellular level**.
		- molecules will move from lower to higher concentration, cells want to throw away some molecules so those may be released in the blood and be excreted from kidneys
- endo/exocytosis is mostly in micro-organisms but can also be in animal cells

- organelle means anything found inside the cell
- anything related to ==cyto== means related to cells
- filament hold everything together in the cell
both do similiar things, and are not used for absorption but there is a fundamental difference between the structure, they are locomotery to move, humans dont have them because we have legs, but inside the human body such as the trachea which takes air, so cilia and flagella act as a filter:
- cilia: are small and many
- flagella: are long and few
metabolism: breaking and making 
- catabolism: break down molecules into smaller
	- use to released energy
- anabolism: build larger molecules from smaller
	- used to store energy
mitochondria: turns food into energy namely ATP
- electron transport chain: in the cristae of the mitochondria
- citric acid cycle: in the matrix of the mitochondria
## glycolysis
is anaerobic: process which can operate without the presence of oxygen, but it also produces byproducts such as lactic acid and ethanol and if the concentration of this increases then it is harmful to the cell
- input: ATP and glucose
- output: ATP and pyruvate
## Krebs cycle
- inputs: pyruvate and oxygen
- outputs: NADH and 2 ATP
## Electron transport chain
- inputs: oxygen and 
- output: ATP, water and carbon dioxide
