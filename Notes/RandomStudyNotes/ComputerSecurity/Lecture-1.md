- transitive attack: attacker will access another machine that has sensitive material through the attacked machine, which may not have sensitive material
- No network is 100% secure
- Pattern:
	- Threat agents give rise to Threats (possibilities) and look/exploits for Vulnerabilities to Penetrate (Risk) which can damage an Asset, where all of this can be prevented by a Safeguard which closes the vulnerabilities.

>[!info] Threat
>Possibility of an attack OR anything that can exploit a vulnerability

- the information asset will have:
	- C: confidentiality, no one can access the data without permission
		- tools for confidentiality:
			- encryption
			- access control: limit access to information for those with permission, what each person can do after logging in
			- authorization: allow access to a system or not, it can be authorization of data, machine, or network
	- I: Integrity (modified) no one can change that data, other than the owner
		- Prevention Mechanisms:
			- authentication: prove who you are as opposed to authorization: what thing you can do
		- Detection Mechanisms:
			- can be deep packet inspection or monitoring anomalous behavior 
		- threats:
			- spoofing: impersonation
	- A: (availability) I can view the data whenever I want
		- tools for availability:
			- redundancies
			- firewall
			- intrusion prevention
>[!important] Repudiation
>- User did something, but denies it, and there is no evidence to prove that the user actually did it.
>	- Repudiation of Origin: The user started it as opposed to someone else starting it, thus having the ability to deny doing it easily.
>- if there is evidence, then we can say there is non-repudiation
