# how to build personal budget
- 50 30 20 rule: 
	- 50 percent of money to the "needs", needs are what is really needed by you depending if you are single or married etc, and food, rent and bills.
	- 30 percent money to the "wants", for example, outings, travelling, fancy mobile phones and cars etc.
	- 20 percent for saving or investment: specify this money for saving account
- for saving, have clear financial objectives so we can achieve them:
	- short term goals:
		- buying mobile
		- travelling abroad
		- buying furniture
	- long term goals:
		- achieving financial independence
		- starting business
		- retirement
- and it is preferred to keep all the separated money in different envelopes/accounts, so make it difficult for you to approach your savings account, and never approach the savings account
- the above relies on the 20 percent
- emergency fund: make a goal for the amount that should be in your emergency at all times, and this fund will be used for situations such as health, and will never touch it unless emergency and is different from savings, so from the savings section, take a certain amount and put it for the emergency fund

- important rule: live within our limits, don't need to buy luxurious stuff just to get indebted
	- monitor and evaluate your financial plan whether it has been achieved or not, if not then, then will need to increase your savings percent when you do the 50 30 20 rule
