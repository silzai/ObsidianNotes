# Introduction
- On the 25th of September as part of our requirement for the course UNIV200 (Innovation, Leadership and Civic Engagement), we had a civic engagement activity that focused on the "Philanthropic Giving" aspect of civic engagement, below I describe how the practical side went.

# initial planning
- To start, my team and I discussed ideas on the kind of activities that we would like to do. The main purpose was giving charity, and selling stuff would encourage people to give charity, and so we planned on bringing snacks, scarves, and games, and discussed what item each person would bring. My idea was to bring an instant polaroid camera and take pictures of people, but half of my team disagreed with this, but when I did bring it they were excited and most people that came were interested in the camera and they gave charity for a picture.

# main event
- All of my colleagues brought many things that surprised me and this made the charity event very interesting, for example, one colleague cooked a rice dish himself, another brought perfumes, and others brought fun games such as a claw-machine game etc. All of this was a good way to "force" people to give charity.
- For the charity event, not many people came even though a university wide email was sent, but we know that people in general do not have time and they have to go for other businesses, and it was a Wednesday so people were already less due to there being less classes.
- We earned around 90 QR for charity which is not much itself, but combined with everyone else's stalls, I believe it would be accumulated to a big amount and used in a good way by the charity organization that came to the university.

# Reflections
- This event made me realize that a group effort or "collective action" is very important, and we can achieve things on a larger scale when done as a group as opposed to doing it alone, and in that, all of my classmates that brought separate interesting things (of which many even surprised me) contributed greatly to the cause.
- I also found out that doing activities that are fun for people to do attracts them more than simply saying that they have to give charity (which is a sad reality), so I realized that was the point of holding an event like this.
- I do agree that the good things about the event did outweigh the mistakes since we did get the charity, but I found something that was lacking in most groups and mine and the whole event in general was the education. Specifically, telling people about what was happening in Gaza and Palestine was close to none (aside from the posters), which was the whole point of the activity. We did collect charity, but while reflecting now, I realize that we never inspired people on why they were giving charity so that was a mistake on my part and the event.
- Further, if people knew that their contribution was going to the right cause, and they are making a difference, then that would have increased our donations, but that is my opinion, so education and goal setting is also important in these events.
