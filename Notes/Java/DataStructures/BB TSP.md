- set minlength as infinity
- conditions:
	- bound less than minlength
- will start from a city
- will look at the outgoing lengths
- will go to the min outgoing length
- and continue to do so
- consequence of doing like this will make us visit the same city again but we can ignore cuz it is bound
start:
- calculate bound by summing all the outgoing lengths of all nodes, and that will be the bound of our dreams
- if node is promising then we will queue its children
- will calculate bound by picking a node after v1 named v? and then summing the minlengths of all nodes in the sequence in state spaced tree but excluding the node v? and the previous node at a particular node we are at. so will exclude only 2 nodes values, while summing the rest.
