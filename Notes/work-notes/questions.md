- will we deploy kubernetes on cloud (with managed clusters), or local cluster?
	- if local, then will we use kubeadm?
- apache airflow and kafka are 2 different architectural ideas, 
	- because one is scheduled batch processing, and the other is stream processing, so which one will be appropriate to our usecase?
- is apache spark only for stream processing?
	- if so, then apache kafka already has streams processing api on its consumers
